# Active work

Updated **2026-10-17**. [Status](STATUS.md) owns delivery boundaries;
[Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) orders future work.

## Dashboard retry controls

- [x] Add Retry build for failed/interrupted rows, background queue/service API,
  duplicate/busy guards and restricted installed publisher helper.
- [x] Add helper/API regression tests; validate rendered desktop/mobile controls.
- [ ] Update the server with `install-dashboard.sh`; operator verifies one retry
  survives closing the browser/SSH session.

[Validation and deployment boundaries](archive/2026-10-17/dashboard-retry.md).

## Native input/write handoff

- [x] Repair and verify normal Cosmos VS Code Debug/Release ISO builds; operator
  confirms they work. Cosmos stays pinned at 3.0.89.
- [x] Implement finite shell stdin, guarded regular-file write/create/truncate/
  append/flush, resource limits and cleanup; add independent Sunbeam `tee`/stdin `cat`.
- [x] Declare the native I/O capability and update references/manuals.
- [x] Pass clean-source common acceptance at `2a515e8`: 109 controllers, 632 host,
  71 login/session, 92 repository, expanded native programs and 169 kernel checks.
- [x] Push `kernel/v0.0.16`, `sunbeam-tools/v0.3.0` and
  `zenith-man-pages/v0.1.1` at that exact tested source.
- [ ] Observe server builds/publication and operator installation. Confirm the
  new kernel before upgrading Sunbeam; exercise piped input and persistent writes.

[Detailed evidence and failed attempts](archive/2026-10-16/native-input-and-writes.md).
The long GUI gate uses virtio keyboard; separate standard-VGA recovery retains
PS/2 coverage. Sustained legacy PS/2 input loss in the affected QEMU graphical
profile remains open in [Shell](components/SHELL.md).

Interactive TTY, streaming byte pipes, seek and general process scheduling remain
future slices. Existing recovery builtins and read-only ABI-1 binaries stay supported.
